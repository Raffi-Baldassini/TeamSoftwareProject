# TeamSoftwareProject - Group 8

## Final Release Documentation

## About the Project:

This typing trainer was developed as a means to practice touch typing, receiving feedback with every attempt and a way to collate your practice data over and extended period of time. Using Markov Chains, we generate text that closely mirrors real life applications. It was developed as a flask web app, and using JavaScript as the front end for the gameplay. The beta release only uses text generated from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, but the final release will have a variety of sources to pull from to generate the practice sets.

## Running the Project:

### From Your Local Machine:

1. If you wish to run the beta offline and directly from your machine, then you will need to download the development branch as a zip file
or use the command `git clone  https://github.com/Raffi-Baldassini/TeamSoftwareProject.git`

2. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. In the Source directory, use the command `flask run` to start the server and then go to the IP address it tells you it is running on

### From Hosted Version:
